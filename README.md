# 2023-NBA-Historical-Comps

# Overview
This project aims to use statistics, K-Means Clustering, and Euclidean distance to give each NBA player from the 2023-24 a historical comparsion.

# Introduction
In discussions of the NBA, a notable topic has been the comparison of current players to players from previous eras. Who is the new Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, or Lebron? With a new wave of young players starting to make their mark, I wanted to know the true historical comparisons for current players instead of the eye-test or speculation.
